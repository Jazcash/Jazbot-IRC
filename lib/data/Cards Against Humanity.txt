- Phase 1
	Game is initiated with 
		!cag start -t 30 (30 minute timer) (default 0)
		!cag start -p 20 (First to 20 points) (default 20)

	Bot gathers all player names in channel, adds them to dictionary:
		{"username":"Jazcash", "nickname", "points":0, "cardsinhand":[{"text":"blah blah blah"}], "turnsmissed": 2}
	
	Give every player 10 cards:
		{"text":"blah blah blah"}

- Phase 2

	Round Variables:
		Answers: {cards, "submittedBy":"Jazcash"}
		Votes: {"Jazcash":2, "Tim":1 etc}

	
	PM every player their cards (numbered) and query them for their selection of answers:
		!answer 1 4
	
	Validate if !answer is valid for each player
	
	Set a timer for 30 seconds and if by that point not all answers have been given then state: "Still waiting for answers from Jazcash, Leigh and Adam"
	
	Set a timer for 10 seconds and if by then there are still missing answers then force those players to submit random choices

	If a player has missed 3 turns then eject them from the game and put their cards back into the answers pile

	After all players have submitted answers or round timer is up then state all answers injected into the round question (numbered but in a random order) and ask each player to vote on their favourite answer (players can't vote for themselves)

	Add up the votes and declare the favourite answer and player of said answer to everybody.
	If there is more than one favourite then give all the favourites +1 points and declare all the answers

	Add +1 to the round number

	For each player, give them answer cards until their total number of cards is 10

	Repeat Phase 2 until winning condition is met

- Phase 3
	Player with most points wins, delcare it to all players and end the game, reset variables etc
