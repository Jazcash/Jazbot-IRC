#tithub <Mozart> Francois rejected it
#tithub <Awia> Odd
#tithub <Awia> This doesn't have anything to do with testMate anyway
#tithub <Mozart> He was like
#tithub <Mozart> No! Silly SUZ.
#tithub <Awia> It's a R&D PR
#tithub <Awia> In your TSR
#tithub <Mozart> And he hit you with his Buat hammer.
#tithub <Mozart> he's our ADBS guy though
#ec <Awia> Thanks
#tithub <Mozart> also
#tithub <Mozart> if you have to email him
#tithub <Awia> Do different subsystem PRs share numbers?
#tithub <Mozart> just be aware that he swears a lot
#tithub <Mozart> no
#tithub <PyBorg> Node is fucking awesome
#tithub <Awia> Odd
#tithub <Mozart> I think it's just PR#++
#tithub <Awia> It is
#tithub <Mozart> AFAIK
#tithub <Awia> But I was wondering if it started from 1 in each subsystem
#tithub <Mozart> I don't think so
#tithub <Mozart> because
#tithub <Mozart> If I search PR1
#tithub <Awia> Can you get at the "Tools" PRs?
#tithub <PyBorg> I like water
#tithub <Mozart> I only get one result
#tithub <Mozart> erm
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, fair enough
#tithub <Mozart> link me one?
#tithub <Awia> I can't from inside RT
#tithub <Awia> That and I've forgotten my RT log in
#tithub <Awia> But on the left of RT you can change your subsystem
#tithub <Awia> thanks Jazbot
#ec <PyBorg> Was an error
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Hahahahha
#ec <Awia> Success!
#tithub <Awia> And you can change from "Core" or whatever to "Tools"
#tithub <Awia> I don't want your wisdom jazbot
#tithub <Mozart> oh
#tithub <Mozart> no
#tithub <Mozart> I just have CORE TTH and NSS
#tithub <Awia> Which one were you on?
#tithub <PyBorg> We need you were doing some more C++
#tithub <Mozart> I don't need to select a System in the Dashboard
#tithub <Mozart> just PR number
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, good point
#tithub <Mozart> and it brings up the revelant one
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Jazbot broke :s
#ec <Jazcash> lies
#ec <PyBorg> Was here guys
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Weird

#ec <Jazcash> lol
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, deffo PR 2487
#tithub <Awia> Says it in the TSR
#tithub <Awia> for the FOCcpl
#tithub <Awia> Apparently PRs can have the same numbers if they're in a different project
#tithub <Awia> Which makes sense
#ec <Brominator> staph
#ec <Brominator> please staph
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> It doesn't even mention it's for autistics
