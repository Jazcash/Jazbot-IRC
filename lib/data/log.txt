#tithub <Mozart> Francois rejected it
#tithub <Awia> Odd
#tithub <Awia> This doesn't have anything to do with testMate anyway
#tithub <Mozart> He was like
#tithub <Mozart> No! Silly SUZ.
#tithub <Awia> It's a R&D PR
#tithub <Awia> In your TSR
#tithub <Mozart> And he hit you with his Buat hammer.
#tithub <Mozart> he's our ADBS guy though
#ec <Awia> Thanks
#tithub <Mozart> also
#tithub <Mozart> if you have to email him
#tithub <Awia> Do different subsystem PRs share numbers?
#tithub <Mozart> just be aware that he swears a lot
#tithub <Mozart> no
#tithub <PyBorg> Node is fucking awesome
#tithub <Awia> Odd
#tithub <Mozart> I think it's just PR#++
#tithub <Awia> It is
#tithub <Mozart> AFAIK
#tithub <Awia> But I was wondering if it started from 1 in each subsystem
#tithub <Mozart> I don't think so
#tithub <Mozart> because
#tithub <Mozart> If I search PR1
#tithub <Awia> Can you get at the "Tools" PRs?
#tithub <PyBorg> I like water
#tithub <Mozart> I only get one result
#tithub <Mozart> erm
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, fair enough
#tithub <Mozart> link me one?
#tithub <Awia> I can't from inside RT
#tithub <Awia> That and I've forgotten my RT log in
#tithub <Awia> But on the left of RT you can change your subsystem
#tithub <Awia> thanks Jazbot
#ec <PyBorg> Was an error
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Hahahahha
#ec <Awia> Success!
#tithub <Awia> And you can change from "Core" or whatever to "Tools"
#tithub <Awia> I don't want your wisdom jazbot
#tithub <Mozart> oh
#tithub <Mozart> no
#tithub <Mozart> I just have CORE TTH and NSS
#tithub <Awia> Which one were you on?
#tithub <PyBorg> We need you were doing some more C++
#tithub <Mozart> I don't need to select a System in the Dashboard
#tithub <Mozart> just PR number
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, good point
#tithub <Mozart> and it brings up the revelant one
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Jazbot broke :s
#ec <Jazcash> lies
#ec <PyBorg> Was here guys
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Weird
#ec <Jazcash> >_>
#ec <Jazcash> lol
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, deffo PR 2487
#tithub <Awia> Says it in the TSR
#tithub <Awia> for the FOCcpl
#tithub <Awia> Apparently PRs can have the same numbers if they're in a different project
#tithub <Awia> Which makes sense
#ec <Brominator> staph
#ec <Brominator> please staph
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> It doesn't even mention it's for autistics
#ec <Awia> Go fix that
#ec <PyBorg> Etc lib media opt root run selinux sys usr
#ec <Jazcash> what have you done to pyborg dan
#ec <PyBorg> Just for you mean dan?
#jazbot <Brominator> sup

#ec <Awia> Ahhhh
#ec <Awia> But why
#ec <Awia> Are those the only warsow servers online?
#ec <Awia> Lol
#ec <Jazcash> naw
#ec <Jazcash> Just top 5
#ec <Mozart> oh
#ec <Mozart> I said that before Jasper
#ec <Awia> Top 5 servers contain only 2 people at most
#ec <Awia> lol
#ec <Awia> dead game
#ec <Jazcash> Naw
#ec <Jazcash> It's just that the only people that play it are people with lives
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> 2/16 "top 5"
#ec <Jazcash> So they can only play it when they're back from work
#ec <Awia> dead
#ec <Awia> game
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> ded gaem

#ec <Jazcash> inb4 not stopping hahaha much jokes ur so funny i wish i was u hahaha
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> But you could be the 3rd person on the most popular Warsow server
#ec <LeighIsNowAMuslim> Then you only need 13 more

#tithub <David> Sure you can Adam
#tithub <Elle> I'd join the sex club but then it's stafford, all the guys would be too scared to join

#tithub <PyBorg> Elle already
#tithub <ADTerminal> thats a good question
#tithub <Elle> omg Sam
#tithub <ADTerminal> i suppose so is the answer
#tithub <David> Smooth :D
#tithub <Elle> Nah, key parties sound stupid
#tithub <David> Hmmm
#tithub <ADTerminal> you need to ask yourself if you're okay with being caught with furry shit in the workplace
#tithub <David> I'm good thanks
#tithub <Elle> I don't want to go home with the minger
#tithub <PyBorg> Fuck it good for?
#tithub <Jazcash_> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
#tithub <Awia> Elle: You solve this by only inviting attractive people
#tithub <David> pyborg agrees elle
#tithub <PyBorg> He does David read what we're saying and spew it?
#tithub <David> Boom
#tithub <David> like me
#tithub <Awia> Like Dave
#tithub <ADTerminal> Pyborg senpai
#tithub <David> I don't own a car
#tithub <PyBorg> The word senpai
#tithub <David> so it would be the keys to my heart
#tithub <Elle> yeah, none of us have keys :(
#tithub <PyBorg> Chicken nuggets would be nice
#tithub <David> such is a knife
#tithub <Awia> Put your house keys in the bowl and then walk home
#tithub <Elle> awwww Dave-kun <333333333
#tithub <Elle> but we'll be living in the same house
#tithub <Jazcash_> Pyborg wants chicken nuggets
#tithub <Awia> Put your room key in the bowl
#tithub <ADTerminal> anyway i've got stuff to do so see you guys
#tithub <Awia> Then walk to 5 feet
#tithub <PyBorg> Hi guys
#tithub <Awia> Cya Sam!
#tithub <PyBorg> Yes Sam
#tithub <Jazcash_> like fuck have you got stuff to do
#tithub <David> bye!
#tithub <PyBorg> Bye!
#tithub <ADTerminal> peace pyborg
#tithub <Elle> see ya!
#tithub <PyBorg> You really ADTerminal
#tithub <Awia> Yeah, he's lying
#tithub <Awia> Visit again!
#tithub <ADTerminal> will do
#tithub <Jazcash_> lol
#tithub <David> My team leader will be back from lunch soon
#tithub <PyBorg> Pyborg commands:
#tithub <PyBorg> IRC Module Commands:
#tithub <Jazcash> Not you >_>
#tithub <Jazcash> It kind of saddens me pyborg's reply range is so limited
#tithub <PyBorg> It makes me feel uncomfortable
#tithub <Jazcash> I wish he remembered ALL words and phrases, not just common things and making common links
#tithub <Jazcash> I want to hear really obscure things we talked about months and months ago
#tithub <Jazcash> But he tends to only bring up single old words or recent phrases which sucks
#tithub <Jazcash> If I had time I'd write my own and do it properly
#tithub <Jazcash> Or rather, if I cba
#tithub <PyBorg> To find a way
#tithub <Awia> colourful
#tithub <Jazcash> NOOO
#tithub <PyBorg> What has opposite got to do
#tithub <Jazcash> Ultra Hardcore (UHC)
#tithub <Jazcash> A Minecraft gamemode where you can only heal with golden apples and health potions.
#tithub <PyBorg> Is wrong
#tithub <Awia> Oh no!
#tithub <Jazcash> it's !say
#tithub <Jazcash> urdoinitrong
#tithub <Jazcash> oh
#tithub <Jazcash> :(
#tithub <Jazcash> rly
#tithub <Awia> I'm sorry your commands are case sensitive for some reason
#tithub <Jazcash> why wouldn't they be
#tithub <Jazcash> It's the same as bash
#tithub <Awia> is pyborg?
#tithub <PyBorg> Is true
#tithub <Jazcash> Case sensitive?
#tithub <PyBorg> Where the point?
#tithub <PyBorg> I know 1054 words (15809 contexts, 15.00 per word), 4350 lines.
#tithub <Jazcash> Nope
#tithub <PyBorg> I know 1054 words (15809 contexts, 15.00 per word), 4350 lines.
#tithub <Jazcash> He doesn't use an argument parser though
#tithub <Jazcash> Or a command dictionary lookup system :P
#tithub <Jazcash> Wow
#tithub <Jazcash> Holy shit
#tithub <PyBorg> Oh shit
#tithub <Jazcash> ha
#tithub <Jazcash> The chances of that
#tithub <Jazcash> Are pretty slim I'd say
#tithub <Awia> What, because we were talking about it earlier?
#tithub <Jazcash> yeah
#tithub <Jazcash> and it's quite specific
#tithub <Awia> I just think it makes more sense to have commands be case insensitive on irc
#tithub <Jazcash> Yeah, probably, but it's not really a big deal
#tithub <Awia> It's a big deal to me
#tithub <Awia> I think that's enough of that!
#tithub <Awia> Put a weather command in
#tithub <Jazcash> Wait what
#tithub <Jazcash> "Loading Reddit thread..."
#tithub <Jazcash> Kiwiirc can load reddit threads??
#tithub <Jazcash> It's not loading for me though :9
#tithub <Awia> It's not loading for me either
