Cards Against Humanity

!cag start
!cag stop

- Phase 1
	Game is initiated with 
		!cag start -t 30 (30 minute timer)
		!cag start -p 20 (First to 20 points)

	Bot gathers all player names, adds them to dictionary:
		{"name":"Jazcash", "points":0, "cardsinhand":[{"text":"blah blah blah"}]}
	
	Give every player 7 cards:
		{"text":"blah blah blah"}

- Phase 2
	State a question card in main chat and whose turn it is
	
	PM every player their cards (numbered) and query them for their selection of answers:
		!answer 1 4
	
	Validate if !answer is valid for each player
	
	Set a timer for 30 seconds and if by that point not all answers have been given then state: "Still waiting for answers from Jazcash, Leigh and Adam"
	
	Set a timer for 10 seconds and if by then there are still missing answers then force those players to submit random choices
